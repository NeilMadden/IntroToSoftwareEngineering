# Fundamentals

In this chapter we will learn the fundamentals of programming, using JavaScript as our programming language. JavaScript
is chosen because it is a relatively simple language (mostly) and because you almost certainly already have a
development environment for it: your web browser. See [Getting Started](../../#getting-started) for how to set
up your web browser.

The basic elements of any programming language consist of *values* of different *types* and *expressions* involving
those values that compute a result. Computing a result is known as *evaluating* an expression, and is the essence of
what computing is. For example, the expression `1 + 1` evaluates to the value `2` which is a number. Other types of
values include Boolean (true/false) values, strings of text, and more complex types and structures. Later, we will also
consider *statements* that allow our programs to perform actions and interact with the outside world. For instance, the
statement `alert('Hello!');` pops up a message box with the given message.
