# Fundamentals

In this chapter we will learn the fundamentals of programming, using JavaScript as our programming language. JavaScript
is chosen because it is a relatively simple language (mostly) and because you almost certainly already have a
development environment for it: your web browser. See [Getting Started](../../#getting-started) for how to set
up your web browser.

The basic elements of any programming language consist of values of different types and expressions involving those
values that compute a result. Computing a result is known as evaluating an expression, and is the essence of what
computing is. Later, we will also consider statements that allow our programs to perform actions and interact with the
outside world.
